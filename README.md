# kindergartengame

This is a series of 3 games built to help teach kindergarten math concepts.  The project focuses on three important mathmatical concepts that build a strong foundation for kindergarten students.  The subjects are simple arithmetic, shape recognition, and counting.

#Arithmetic
The game Adding With Lion deals with teaching arithmetic by giving each student a series of simple addition problems.  

#Shape Recognition
Shapes (Stephen, please name your game) teaches shape recognition with a fun an creative game.  In this game, the students are to help Steve the Strawberry navigate his way through a maze.  In order to help advance Steve in any direction, students must first match a shape to a description.  

#Counting
The game Trick Master Tyrone helps teach counting to children by offering a fun and intense game of keep-up with Tyrone the Turtle and a soccer ball.  In the game, students must keep a soccer ball from touching the ground by bouncing the ball on Tryone's shell.  As the student progresses in the game, their score or number of hits is announced verbally so they can hear the numbers in order.  At the end, the student is asked what number comes before their score as a counting test.
